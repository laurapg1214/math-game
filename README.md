**10-second Math Game**<br>
Simple math game with 10-second countdown timer, options for maximum number and replay. <br>
Created as part of Altcademy's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.<br><br>
**Approach**
- used querySelector instead of jQuery to get used to vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation (as had used jQuery in other projects)
<br>

**Planned updates** 
- changing timer 1-sec bonus for correct answer from adding 1 to timer to using Date.now() for greater timing precision
- clock ticking audio in time with countdown timer
